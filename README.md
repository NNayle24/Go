# Go AI Project

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a Go game AI developed in C. The AI uses a combination of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and heuristic evaluations to play Go effectively against human opponents or against itself. This project was designed and developed as part of our CS curriculum by a team of four students.
